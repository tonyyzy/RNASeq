[2019-03-17 18:33:01.247] [jointLog] [info] Computed 4 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-03-17 18:33:01.247] [jointLog] [info] Counted 590 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-17 18:33:01.249] [jointLog] [warning] Only 590 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
