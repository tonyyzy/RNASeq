[2019-03-17 18:33:02.324] [jointLog] [info] Counted 520 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-17 18:33:02.325] [jointLog] [warning] Only 520 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
