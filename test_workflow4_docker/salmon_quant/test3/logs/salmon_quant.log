[2019-03-17 18:33:03.352] [jointLog] [info] Computed 4 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-03-17 18:33:03.352] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2630 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-17 18:33:03.353] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2630 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
