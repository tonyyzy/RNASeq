[2019-03-17 16:58:33.856] [jointLog] [info] Counted 520 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-17 16:58:33.857] [jointLog] [warning] Only 520 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
