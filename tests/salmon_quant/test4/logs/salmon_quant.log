[2019-03-18 04:38:08.766] [jointLog] [info] Counted 590 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 04:38:08.768] [jointLog] [warning] Only 590 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
