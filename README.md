# RNASeq

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tonyyzy/RNASeq.svg?token=5Fwptxoz1iaezXoMzRSd&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tonyyzy/RNASeq)

# We will probably drop nodocker support soon...it's becoming harder to account for both versions
Death to no docker !!!!!!!!!!

Ah you think docker is your ally? You merely adopted the docker. I was born in it, molded by it.

Sure but the docker is strong in me !!!!!!!!

## Notes
DESeq2 requires metadata sample name to match gene_count_matrix sample name
will handle this in workflow to make things consistent

## Session status definition
0 session initialised  
1 session submitted (no change to conditions/samples/workflows allowed pass this stage)  
2 workflow generated  
3 workflow submitted to run  
4 workflow finished  

## Some libraries needed to setup local dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev
```

## Testing

We use `python` and `pytest` as the testing framework. All the tests are stored in `./tests`. Before committing a new test, you should test your test locally first.

Assuming you have all dependencies met

run `$ pytest ./tests`

You should see something similar to the following:

```
$ pytest tests
